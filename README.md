# Iconic

This React application takes what the user types and replaces words with icons.

Try creating this application by starting from the template application, and referencing this repository if you get stuck. You'll want to grab the list of [icon names](./src/icons.json), however.

### Challenges

* Make sure your application handles punctuation. For example: "Hug a tree!"
* Make sure your application handles different cases. For example: "Hug a TREE"
* Make sure your application handles plurals. For example: "I love trees".
* Make each icon a random color. *Hint: the [style](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-elements.html#style) attribute.*
* Give the text input component focus so you can start typing immediately.
* When you click on an icon, replace the icon with the word that it represents. *Hint: you'll need to store clicked-on words in the state.*
